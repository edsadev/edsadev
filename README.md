ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Edmundo Salamanca, a passionate front-end developer and future full-stack developer. With 3+ years of experience in web development and a strong foundation in React, I possess a diverse skill set that includes a wide range of front-end technologies such as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, as well as various libraries and frameworks like Next.js, ReactJs, Redux, i18n, Tailwind, and Vue.

As a person, I am dynamic, efficient, and highly communicative, with a passion for technology and a continuous thirst for learning. My ability to work collaboratively and deliver high-quality work under budget and on time makes me an asset to any project.

If you're interested in my profile and want to collaborate on a project, feel free to contact me at e.salamanca@edsadev.com, I'll be happy to get in touch.âœ¨

"At the end, I strive to make a positive impact on the present and future through simple actions as a human being." ðŸš€
