- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @edsadev
I'm a frontend developer studying to be a full stack. My stack for web development is React for UI and Redux por state management. Nowadays, I'm working with NextJs framework in personal projects. I have big interest in blockchain development too, some of my repos are courses of smart contracts for Ethereum Blockchain. I really enjoy coding, my daily motivation is to learn more and more to impact in our latam community with projects that improve life quality.

In the end, I'm just a simple human being, doing simple things on a daily basis to make a big impact in the present future ðŸš€
